# Keep in touch landing page!

### What for and why?
A minimal page that let's users subscribe via e-mail.
The script will send name and e-Mail Address to a given E-Mail (site owner).
This is not ment to work with any newsletter apps it's just a way to quickly set up a page and be present for your audiance while your are working on the real stuff.


### Technical stuff
The CSS is based on [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) and can be easily adjusted and modified.

Package comes with client side and server side validation. Client side validation is without any framework dependencies to keep it small for small tasks and should work cross browser.
If you happen to run into issues please feel free to track it in the repository issue tracker.

The php script does also implement the concept of csrf tokens.

### Use at own risk
this script works for me and can be freely used and modified by your own risk.
